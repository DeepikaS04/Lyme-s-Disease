# Lyme-s-Disease

Lyme disease is a rapidly growing illness that remains poorly understood within the medical community. It is an infectious vector-borne disease, which can manifest itself in most cases with erythema migrans (EM) skin lesions. The current approaches for tick identification involves molecular methods like gene sequencing in a laboratory, which happens to be time consuming and expensive. Recent studies show that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform well to identify skin lesions from images. The main objective of this study is to extensively analyze the effectiveness of CNNs for diagnosing Lyme disease from images and to find out the best architecture considering the limited resources. According to some studies, this deep learning model competes on par with expert dermatologists for disease diagnosis.
In this project we attempt to design a model with an accuracy above 80% to detect the Lyme's disease.
